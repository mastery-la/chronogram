                    Born on March 25, 1947, in England, Elton John's unique
                    blend of pop and rock styles turned him into one of the
                    biggest music icons of the 20th century. He excelled in
                    music from a young age, and released his first self-titled
                    American album in 1970, making him a huge international
                    star. Some of his most famous hits include "Crocodile Rock,"
                    "Philadelphia Freedom" and "Candle in the Wind." He also
                    found success on Broadway, composing the score for Billy
                    Elliot (2008), which went on to win 10 Tony Awards. He was
                    inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and was
                    knighted in 1998.

                    John married his longtime partner David Furnish in a civil
                    ceremony on December 21, 2005 â€” the same day the Civil
                    Partnership Act 2004 went into effect. With the help of a
                    surrogate, the couple welcomed their first son, Zachary
                    Furnish-John, in December 2010, and welcomed their second
                    child, Elijah Joseph Daniel Furnish-John, in January 2013.
                    Nine years after their civil ceremony, on December 21, 2014,
                    the couple wed after laws allowing gay marriage took effect
                    the same year in Britain.

                    As one of the top acts of the 1970s, John became equally
                    famous for his live shows. He dressed in fabulous,
                    over-the-top costumes and glasses for his elaborate
                    concerts. In an interview with W, John explained that "I
                    wasn't a sex symbol like Bowie, Marc Bolan or Freddie
                    Mercury, so I dressed more on the humorous side, because if
                    I was going to be stuck at the piano for two hours, I was
                    going to make people look at me."

                <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
                    In 1976 John hit the top of the charts again with "Don't Go
                    Breaking My Heart," his duet with Kiki Dee. He soon decided
                    to take a break from music, focusing his energies on his
                    soccer team that he co-owned in England. Around this time,
                    John also publicly announced that he was bisexual (he later
                    came out as a gay man). At the time, John was ridiculed and
                    taunted for his sexuality. The controversy died down, and he
                    made a triumphant return to music in 1979 with the album A
                    Single Man.

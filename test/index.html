                    The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when
                    the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the
                    garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of
                    the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the
                    pink-flowering thorn.

                <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which
                    he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable
                    cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of
                    the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum,
                    whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the
                    burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then
                    the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the
                    long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of
                    the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese
                    effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced
                    painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is
                    necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness
                    and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their
                    way through the long unmown grass, or circling with
                    monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the
                    straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more
                    oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note
                    of a distant organ.

                    In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel,
                    stood the full-length portrait of a young man of
                    extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some
                    little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil
                    Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused,
                    at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many
                    strange conjectures.

                <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
                    As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had
                    so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed
                    across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he
                    suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his
                    fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison
                    within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he
                    might awake.
